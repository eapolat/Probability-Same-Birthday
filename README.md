# Probability-Same-Birthday
A Java program which takes an interval for number of people, and for each group it calculates the probability of people having the same birthday. We use simple control mechanisms to ensure we take the interval input correctly and calculate the probability. 

If you want to get valid results in higher numbers, you need to have a higher number while printing the result. When the inputs get higher, we need more decimal places or it will round up the results and we could have invalid values.
